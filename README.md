# Suggestion de tags

Stack Overflow is a question-and-answer website for computer programmers.
It was created in 2008. It features questions and answers on certain computer programming topics.
As of March 2024 Stack Overflow has over 23 million registered users and has received over 24 million questions and 35 million answers.


For a dataset of 10,000 question-answer pairs, we propose to:
* Perform document preprocessing
* Compare different LLM approaches (such as Gemini) to predict tags
* Implement, in the form of an API, a tag suggestion system for the site, ensuring that the questions are well-referenced and can be easily retrieved.
